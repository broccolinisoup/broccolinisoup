## Hello there 👋 I am Armağan!

I have been developing web-based systems for over 10 years now and within the years of experience, I have found a sweet spot that combines my technical skills with my diversity and inclusion advocacy and it is creating **inclusive, accessible and ethical software.** One great way of achiving this objective is through design systems where we can focus on building individual pieces and making them accessible with a systematic approach. So, pursuing this passion led me here, to [GitHub](https://github.com), where I work as a software engineer on [Primer Design System](https://primer.style) ✨
