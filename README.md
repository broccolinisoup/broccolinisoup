## Hello there 👋 I am Armağan!

I have been developing web applications for a little while now and within the years of experience, I have explored multiple areas of the stack and found my passion in frontend development; especially the sweet spot where I get to combine my technical skills with my advocacy of diversity and inclusion to build **inclusive and accessible software.** One great way of achieving this goal is through design systems where we can focus on building individual pieces and making them accessible with a systematic approach. Pursuing this passion led me here, to [GitHub](https://github.com), where I worked as a software engineer on [Primer Design System](https://primer.style) for over 2 years. ✨ 

Working as a platform engineer has been an incredible addition to my skill set. In a nutshell, it gave me a whole new perspective on problem-solving at scale and seeing the bigger picture—recognizing how a small change can impact other parts of the product ecosystem. I am now working on the other side of the spectrum as a software engineer on GitHub Issues 🔆
