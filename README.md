I am Armağan! 

👩🏼‍💻 I’m a Software Engineer @GitHub and working on our design system [Primer](https://primer.style/)

My professional interests are Design Systems, Compassionate design, Web accessibility and Developer Experience.

I live in sunny Brisbane 🌞 in Australia 🦘 and I love camping, hiking, beach walking, any activity I do with my dog, cooking and reading.
