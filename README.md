## Hello there 👋 I am Armağan!

I have been developing web applications for a little while now and within the years of experience, I have explored multiple areas of the stack and found my passion in frontend development; especially the sweet spot where I get to combine my technical skills with my diversity and inclusion advocacy to build **inclusive, accessible and ethical software.** One great way of achieving this goal is through design systems where we can focus on building individual pieces and making them accessible with a systematic approach. So, pursuing this passion led me here, to [GitHub](https://github.com), where I work as a software engineer on [Primer Design System](https://primer.style) ✨
